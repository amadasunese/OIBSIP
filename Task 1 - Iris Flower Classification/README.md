**The Task**
Iris Flower Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

## Iris Flower Classification Model Report

Introduction

<p>The Iris flower dataset is a classic in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying the species of an Iris flower based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.</p>

<bold>Overview of the dataset</bold>

Dataset contains 150 entries
Features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Target Variable: Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

Missing Values: None
Methodology

Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection: All four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) were used.
Encoding: The species were encoded numerically.
Splitting Data: The data was split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%).
Model Selection and Training
Model Chosen: Decision Tree Classifier
Reason for Selection: Decision Trees are easy to interpret and often perform well on small datasets.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances.
Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the ability of the model to find all relevant instances.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Results

Accuracy on Test Set: 100%
Classification Report:
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were 1.00 for all species.
Decision Tree Visualization

The decision tree was visualized to understand the decision-making process of the model. The visualization provided insights into feature importance and decision thresholds.

Conclusion

The Decision Tree Classifier demonstrated excellent performance on the Iris dataset, achieving 100% accuracy on the test set. The model effectively classified the Iris species based on the given measurements. The visualization of the decision tree provided a clear and interpretable understanding of the model's decision-making process.

Recommendations for Deployment

The model has been saved and is ready for deployment. It is recommended to:

Ensure the preprocessing steps are consistent when deploying the model.
Monitor the model's performance on new, unseen data to verify its generalizability.
Future Work

Validation on External Dataset: To further confirm the model's effectiveness, it can be tested on an external dataset of Iris flowers.
Exploring Other Models: To enhance reliability, other models like Random Forest or SVM could be explored and compared.
Feature Engineering: Investigating additional features or transformations could potentially improve the model's robustness.
